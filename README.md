# Gedcom-FixFtmPubl

GEDCOM files exported from FTM, at least as of now, Sep. 2017, seems to
have midlessly added "Name:" to every PUBL value. This program mindlessly
removes them.

It looks like FTM/Ancestry are trying to formalize a sub-fielding within
that value, with Name, Location, and Date. If so, then it just doesn't
work yet. So, watch this space.
